# Chicago Transit Authority Data Analysis
**“Connecting Chicago, One Ride at a Time”**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of **CTA ridership patterns** using bus, train, weather, holiday, and crime datasets.  
It leverages **R** and **Python** for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, offering insights into passenger demand, external factors, and service optimization.

## Motivation
Public transit in Chicago is influenced by many external factors such as **weather, crime, holidays, and COVID-19**.  
The goal of this project is to identify patterns, forecast demand, and provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving efficiency and safety of CTA operations.

## Objectives
- Identify **routes with highest ridership**
- Compare weekday vs weekend ridership trends
- Assess the impact of **seasons, temperature, holidays, and crime**
- Quantify the **effect of COVID-19** on ridership
- Predict number of trips for future periods
- Provide **recommendations for high-demand routes**
- Visualize ridership density at busiest stations
