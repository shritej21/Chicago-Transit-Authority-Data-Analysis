# Chicago_Transit_Authority_Data_Analysis

In-depth analysis of Chicago Transit Authority ridership data incorporating aspects such as holiday, weather, and crime datasets. The project was executed using R programming and Python, focusing on comprehensive data processing and high-precision analytics.

Features:
1. Data Processing and Cleaning: Ensured data integrity by executing precise data cleaning tasks such as column transformations and imputation.
2. Statistical Modeling: Ready-for-use data processed to perform accurate statistical modeling.
3. Data Visualization: Leveraged both Tableau and ggplot2 to effectively visualize and communicate data insights.
4. 3D Visualization: Adopted plot3D for intricate 3D visualizations, particularly for understanding the correlations in the multiple linear regression model.
5. K-means Clustering: Employed to categorize 194 bus routes based on their unique ridership patterns.

Key Achievements:
Successfully interpreted multi-dimensional correlations using 3D visualizations of the multiple linear regression model.
Attained a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 80.5 using Lasso regression.
Achieved a silhouette score of 0.6334 in k-means clustering, indicating effective and cohesive clustering.
